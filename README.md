What is this Project?

This "AutoCompleteTextField" is a Xojo custom control that is an open source project I have developed for the Xojo community. I wanted an implementation of Auto Complete for the TextField and TextArea controls in Xojo that is similiar to many used on todays web controls.

What is new in v.1.0.2?
- Bug fixes: Issues reported #1-5
- Improved the no-text in field behavior relating to the Autocomplete listbox


Feature Highlights:

- Selectable maximum rows integer for the max size of the autocompletion listbox (IDE provided choice on subclassed object)

- The ability to choose to search and match by "word segments" or treat the target as one large string
 
- The ability to change the SearchStartPostion from searching from left to right or match anywhere in the target string

- You can provide any text file to use as the souce for the autocomplete functions (file must be formatted using UTF-8 encoding and has system end of line breaks)

- Provides user interaction that you would expect suchs as auto row tracking with mouse over the listbox choices
